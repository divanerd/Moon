As of Friday, I completed my first week at <a href="www.thisismetis.com">Metis</a>.  Metis
lived up to it's description--it certainly
felt like a data science bootcamp.  The approach is simple:
tons of content, tons of exploration.  I love the emphasis
on application--from day one, we learned techniques that 
could be applied immediately.


<br>
One of my biggest challanges this past week
has been changing the way I both think about and handle data--
namely in relation to data storage, manipulation and retrieval.  
For the past few years, I've worked mostly with all flavors of SQL 
(MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle SQL).  Easing myself back into 
the object oriented world will be both frustrating and rewarding.  
There were a few parts of our challenged/assignments
that had me thinking "this would be a piece of cake in SQL."  
<br>


But don't worry, I'm convinced that mastering Python
will be worth it for the future.  Just need to put analytical 
functions on the back burner for now.
<br>


Our first project involved analyzing NYC MTA data--super interesting
as a New Yorker myself.  I traveled home for the weekend and
was excited to show my mom some of the data I'd mined for 
stations that have sentimental significance to us.  In fact, this
post is being writen from JetBlue flight 1715.
<br>

I'm looking forward to playing with other "familiar" data.  A few years ago
I built a web app that curated Yelp results for the indecisive, yet
picky eater (JQuery).  Perhaps this will be fun to revisit.
<br>


I'm looking forward to week 2.  This week, my strategy will be to spend
more time outside of class to review (both before and after lecture.)  If I want
to get the most of Metis, I'll need to invest some more time.
