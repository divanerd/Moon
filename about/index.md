Hi, I'm Timan.  In the past <10 years I have worked in Software Engineering, Data Analysis and Business Intelligence roles.  I believe Data Science training will be the proverbial icing on the cake.  I look forward to tackling problems with my new toolset.

## Other things I enjoy
* Visiting other countries (some favs include India, Poland and Denmark)
* Music: EDM, House, Hip Hop
* Food: anything from salmon sashimi to raclette
* Wine
* Investing
* Serving others
